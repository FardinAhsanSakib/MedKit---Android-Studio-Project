# MedKit
This mobile health application is designed to help users achieve their dietary goals by creating personalized meal plans based on their unique information, such as age, height, weight, and dietary restrictions. The plans are generated specifically for Bengali cuisine, and will provide users with appropriate portion sizes for each meal, as well as a list of alternative food options that can be selected to suit individual preferences. Additionally, the application will allow users to track their progress, monitor nutrient intake and provide education on healthy eating habits.
